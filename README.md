## 📝 Description of Project
This Pokédex was built using ReactJS + TypeScript. Initially, the application's boilerplate was created using Vite, which has proven to be quite performant in front-end applications. Styled-components were used due to the significant need to handle CSS to generate conditional styles. The Material UI library was also used to create the pagination for the application. Finally, all the Pokémon data was fetched from the PokéAPI.
